# parcel-events-sdk

Integrate the Parcel Events Sandbox API HTTP API: labels, pickups, rates, shipments, tracking, webhook endpoints. Use when writing code that calls Parcel Events Sandbox API, or when the user mentions labels, pickups, rates, shipments, tracking, webhook endpoints.

## Authentication

Default scheme (`api_key`):

- Send `Parcel-API-Key: <value>` as a request header — value from `PARCEL_EVENTS_API_KEY`.

Escape hatches (other accepted schemes):
- `bearer_token` (bearer): Send `authorization: Bearer <value>` — value from `PARCEL_EVENTS_BEARER_TOKEN`.

## Base URL

This API models 2 environments — decide which one to call:

- If targeting **production** (default), use `https://api.parcel-events.example`.
- If targeting **sandbox**, use `https://sandbox.parcel-events.example`.
